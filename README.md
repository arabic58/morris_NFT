I believe I will need it to be ERC-1155 because each NFT should be 2:2.


So what exactly should the process be? I probably wonâ€™t have all the artwork done until the 28th, but as soon as I do I can email it to you. I can put together a folder with all the files and names for everything and get it to you. Then you can write it all up, and we can meet at Burgeon Beer Co on Sunday the 31st to deploy and mint on my Ledger. How does that sound?
